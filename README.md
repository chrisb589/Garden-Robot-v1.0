# Garden-Robot-v1.0
First attempt at a self-watering indoor garden system powered by an Arduino board

## Physical Set Up
- Water Tower
- Wiring
  - Use garden wire to support pipes / wiring (can braid together for more structural integrity)
- Water Reservoir
- Tubing
  - [] Bring valve to hardware store, ask for tubing.

## Read-out / display / data analysis
### Figure out how to use Processing Language
- From Arduino
  - Got the serial monitor reading only humidity (commented out the temperature / dewpoint readings coming from the sensor)
- Processing
